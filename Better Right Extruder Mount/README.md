## Better Right Extruder Mount

Just a relatively simple 2 part assembly that replaces the existing mounting plate and moves it out by about 17.5mm and mounts it on a rail for more precise up and down movement. You may have to adjust tolerances for your specific printer. I printed these parts on my Prusa MK3 with a 0.25mm nozzle (100% infill, 4-6 perimeters) because I have it very dialed in to be extremely dimensionally accurate, but have not done the same with the JG yet. If things don't fit quite right for you, you might try to make some adjustments using XY compensation in your slicer.

Simply unscrew the 4 M4 bolts in the back of the existing carriage, as well as the M3 jack screw on top to remove the extruder. Then remove the screws holding the mounting plate to the MGN carriage on the printer along with the screws on the bottom holding the belt and the screw on the side holding the endstop trigger. 

Assemble the new mounting plate with a 50mm length of MGN12 rail (you may have to cut this yourself with a dremel tool, they don't sell them that short, but you can buy 100mm length or longer and cut it down.) You'll need 2 M3 nuts and bolts for this.

Insert 3 M3 nuts in the traps in the back of the new plate, then reattach the belt and the endstop trigger on the printer onto the new plate. Then you can install the plate onto the printers MGN carriage using the 4 more M3 screws.

At this point you may want to attach the old plate off the printer onto your MGN carriage from the 50mm rail you cut. Install this one vertically onto the old plate using the original screws. Now you can attach this plate back onto the extruder using 3 of the original screws in all but the bottom left corner. in that corner you will need a longer M4 screw and sandwich in the small square mgn_screw_nut print. Also insert an M4 locknut into the slot and line it up with the hole in the top.

You can now carefully slide this assembly onto the vertical rail on the new mount from the bottom, and insert an M4 screw in the hole on the top of the mounting plate to screw into the nut block. I used a 30 or 35mm length screw. Just make sure it is long enough to get into the nylon of the lock nut. You may also want to install a small spring between the screw and the nut, but gravity should do the job.
